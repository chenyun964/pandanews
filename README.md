# PandaNews
With the continuous development and variability of Covid-19, government measures for the pandemic are also changing rapidly. Different measurements and standards are applied in various industries. These rapid changes in standards and measurements may cause asymmetric information among companies. Hence, companies often need to spend a lot of time verifying the informationâ€™s authenticity and having trouble replying to their consumers in time. Therefore, this project aims to produce an application that helps organisations and businesses to access relevant, reliable, and accurate information related to Covid-19, including news and government measures instantly. The team had developed an application, Pandanews which consists of functions that help companies to recover quickly from the pandemic. Receiving and transmitting information accurately and promptly provides a fast track for business management and planning.
