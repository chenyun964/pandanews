# PandaNews
With the continuous development and variability of Covid-19, government measures for the pandemic are also changing rapidly. Different measurements and standards are applied in various industries. These rapid changes in standards and measurements may cause asymmetric information among companies. Hence, companies often need to spend a lot of time verifying the informationâ€™s authenticity and having trouble replying to their consumers in time. Therefore, this project aims to produce an application that helps organisations and businesses to access relevant, reliable, and accurate information related to Covid-19, including news and government measures instantly. The team had developed an application, Pandanews which consists of functions that help companies to recover quickly from the pandemic. Receiving and transmitting information accurately and promptly provides a fast track for business management and planning. This report also includes information of how the application was developed by the team, such as providing the technical details and software process details. The software process consists of the agile process, project backlog, sprint details, team statistics and some other additional details. On the other hand, the technical details consist of the software design, the API design and implementation, the user interface design, database design, security design, testing details and the continuous integration details.
